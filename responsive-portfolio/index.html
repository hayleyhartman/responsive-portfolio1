        <img class="propic"src="assets/images/me.jpg" alt="picture of Hayley Hartman">

        <p class="abouttext1">I am a full-stack web developer based in Cleveland Ohio. After finishing a BA in Communication at Ohio State University in 2016, I moved out to Wyoming to commune with nature-- not unlike Kanye West, although I would like to point out, I did it first. Now I find myself back in my hometown of Cleveland. When I am not at my job working with special needs kids (they're the best!), I am learning to code.</p>   

        <p class="abouttext2">Besides technology, I also like coffee, my 18-pound tabby cat, Stink, punk music, knitting, and using ABBA photos as placeholder images. Dislikes include sloppy code and bowling. My inbox is always open to questions, job offers, and pictures of your pets.</p>
